# myWebsite

I have hosted a static website about me in this repository.

To see go to https://sharmark9931.github.io/myWebsite

If somehow above link is not working it means this website is no more hosted at https://sharmark9931.github.io/myWebsite because github provides hosting for only one repository. So, maybe I have hosted another website to find our check other repositories also.
